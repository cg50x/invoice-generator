# Invoice Generator App

This webapp allows you to generate an invoice document as a PDF file. Just enter the information in the form and click 'Create Invoice'.

## How To Run

Clone this project and run the following commands:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## Notes

- You need to enable popups in order to set the image logo. This is may be an issue with the `pdfmake` library. Need to find a solution for this.
